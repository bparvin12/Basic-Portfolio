                My name is Bijan Parvin, and I was born in Newport Beach, California on June 16, 1994. I have lived in Orange County, CA my entire life, but have moved eight times in my life from Santa Ana to Irvine to Tustin. 
            </p>

                After graduating from Foothill High School with an IB Diploma, I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry at California State University, Fullerton. I graduated from CSUF in May of 2018, and have been furthering my education by studying software development ever since. While being a fulltime student, I have worked as a lead server at Zov's Bistro in Tustin since 2012.

                In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing sports, hanging out with my friends, and going to local breweries.
