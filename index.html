                My name is Bijan Parvin, and I was born in Newport Beach, California on June 16, 1994. I have lived in Orange County, CA my entire life, but have moved eight times in my life from Santa Ana to Irvine to Tustin.

                After graduating from Foothill High School with an IB Diploma, I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry at California State University, Fullerton. I graduated from CSUF in May of 2018, and have been furthering my education by studying software development ever since. While being a fulltime student, I have worked as a lead server at Zov's Bistro in Tustin since 2012.

                In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing sports, hanging out with my friends, and going to local breweries.
